Based on [BlurImage](https://github.com/sparrow007/BlurImage) library


## Gradle
#### Step 1. Add the dependency

```
dependencies {
    ...
    Implementation 'url'
}
```

#### Step 2. Add the below lines on app module build.gradle file.

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    ...
    renderscriptTargetApi 19
    renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true
}
```


## Usage

Just use as if you're using Glide.

### Directly apply blurred image to ImageView

```koltin
ImageBlur.with(this)
    .load(image) //Bitmap from which blurred image will be created
    .intensity(15.0f) //Blur intensity
    .scale(0.5f) //Scale intensity
    .into(binding?.ivPreview) //Directly apply to image view
```


Other options

### Get blurred bitmap

```koltin
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    val blurredBitmap = ImageBlur.with(this)
                            .load(image)
                            .intensity(15.0f)
                            .scale(0.5f)

                            //There are 2 ways you can get a blurred bitmap

                            .getBlurredImage() //For getting blurred bitmap

                            or

                            .getBlurredImageAsync() //For getting blurred bitmap asynchronously
}
```

## Proguard

If you're using add this below lines to your app level proguard file

```
# RenderScript
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
native <methods>;
}
-keep class androidx.renderscript.** { *; }
